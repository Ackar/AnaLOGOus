This is a simple python implementation of the Logo language.
It allows to write simple code with an immediate and graphic way of visualising it.

Its goal is to introduce beginners to the basics of programmation using python.

INSTALL
_______

You need python 2.7 and the pygame module.

USAGE
_____

The goal of this project is to be in the simplest possible way so that
beginners are not overwhelmed with technical issues.

For that reason, you can use it in different ways :

  - The simplest way is to write the code in src/my_code.py, you can then
  launch program.py, the others files will be automatically included and a
  pause at the end of the drawing will be added :

    $ python my_code.py

  - In an interactive way (with an interactive interpreter) :

    $ python -i analogous.py

  - In any other way, just import analogous into your file.

Available functions :

  - forward(distance)
  - turn_left(angle)
  - turn_right(angle)
  - change_color((r,g,b))
  - change_brush_size(size)
  - hide_brush()
  - show_brush()
  - toggle_brush()
